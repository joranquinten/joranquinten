### Nice to meet you! 👋

You've found my profile. In short, I'm an Engineering Manager with a history (and fondness) of web development from the Eindhoven area in the Netherlands. I currently work for Jumbo.com in **Silicon Veghel**, have a small business in freelance or contribute to open source.

I'm a [public speaker](https://sessionize.com/Joranquinten/), [published](https://www.packtpub.com/en-us/product/building-real-world-web-applications-with-vuejs-3-9781837630394) author and program committee member for The JS Nation conferences in [Amsterdam](https://jsnation.com/) and [New York](https://jsnation.us/).

As a coach/mentor find me on the [Coding Coach platform](https://mentors.codingcoach.io/?name=Joran+Quinten), lots of love for [road cycling](https://www.strava.com/athletes/11554004) and my family. 🫶
